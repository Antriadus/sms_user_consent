# sms_user_consent

> Implements Android's [SMS User Consent API](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/user-consent/overview)


In a nutshell, prompt the user to grant access to the content of a single SMS message. When the user gives consent, you will then have access to the entire message body.

**Bonus:** You can even request user's phone number (supports dual sim phones).

## Steps to use

1] Create an instance, **optionally** supply phone number listener and sms listener
```
SmsUserConsent smsUserConsent = SmsUserConsent(
        // optionally, do something when user selects a number.
        // You can even add/update this listener later on by simply 
        // calling smsUserConsent.updatePhoneNumberListener(updatedListener)
        phoneNumberListener: () {},
        
        // optionally, do something when user receives sms.
        // You can even add/update this listener later on by simply 
        // calling smsUserConsent.updateSmsListener(updatedListener)
        smsListener: () {}
);
```

2] **OPTIONAL** :  Request user's phone number

<img src="https://github.com/pharshdev/sms_user_consent/blob/master/ss4.png" width="250" />

```
smsUserConsent.requestPhoneNumber();
```
Once the user selects a phone number, it can be accessed as
```
smsUserConsent.selectedPhoneNumber;
```

3] Request to receive SMS 
```
smsUserConsent.requestSms(); 
```
or you can specify the phone number you wish to capture the SMS from
```
smsUserConsent.requestSms(senderPhoneNumber: sender_number);
```
Once the user receives a SMS and the user taps **Allow**, it can be accessed as
```
smsUserConsent.receivedSms;
```

4] Finally, dispose the instance
```
smsUserConsent.dispose();
```

### Note

As per the [SMS User Consent API](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/user-consent/overview),  message will be received by the plugin only if it meets these criteria:

* The message contains a 4-10 character alphanumeric string with at least one number.
* The message was sent by a phone number that's not in the user's contacts.
* If you specified the sender's phone number, the message was sent by that number.
